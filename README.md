# accharplanner-react-mobx

Super WIP proof of concept of building an Asheron's Call character planner with just React and MobX.
Based on [mobx-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-boilerplate/).

So far, this is proving much more painful than just using Vue.js but it's still fun to try to shoehorn it in.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
